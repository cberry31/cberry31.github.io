# Colton Berry

As a Software Developer at Infinity Solar USA, I leverage my expertise in Python, Terraform, Docker, and
other cutting-edge technologies to architect innovative automations and services that drive the
company's exponential growth.
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Washington State University of Vancouver, where I
honed my skills in Python, Java, and C while spearheading diverse projects. During my academic journey,
I collaborated with the Clark County Sheriff's Department to develop a groundbreaking program,
streamlining their inmate transfer process through effective automation.
Currently, I adeptly manage a dynamic portfolio of over 50 microservices, pivotal in propelling the
company towards unprecedented heights. My commitment to continuous learning and development fuels my
passion for staying ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
Eager for new challenges and opportunities, I am poised to contribute my expertise to ambitious projects
that align with my commitment to excellence in software development.
